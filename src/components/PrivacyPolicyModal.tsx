                  ReachMD may collect some of your contact information and professional information from pharmaceutical companies that provide us with physician level data (PLD), which we then use to track the content you listen to and/or view on or through the Services. The pharmaceutical companies that provide us with your PLD may receive professional information about any ReachMD courses you attend or other Services you use as a result of this process.

                  There are other areas of the Services where Personal Data or other information may be collected from you in an automated manner. When you visit or use certain Services, for example, we may automatically collect certain Device Information about your computer, browser or device that includes information about your web browser, such as your IP address, time zone, and some of the cookie identifiers that are installed on your device. ReachMD will treat such device information as Personal Data to the extent such device information is reasonably capable of identifying a particular individual.

                  The Services may use "cookies" to enhance the User's experience. For example, cookies are placed on your hard drive when you visit the Site for record-keeping purposes to better understand how Users interact with the Services, optimize response times, remember what language you prefer, and sometimes to track authentication information to prevent unauthorized access to Users' accounts. A User may choose to set their web browser or mobile device to refuse or disable cookies. If cookies are blocked by Users, some parts of our Services may not function properly.

                  ReachMD may also use third-party service providers which collect and aggregate information to analyze how Users move around the Services, in order to optimize the performance of the Services. For example, the Services may use Google Analytics, which is a web analytics service that uses online tracking tools to analyze how you use aspects of the Services. The information collected by these cookies about your use of the Services (including page views, scrolls, videos or links that were clicked, a unique client ID attributable to your device and browser information, your approximate age, gender, interests, language settings on your device or browser, and approximate location metadata derived from your IP address (city, state, and country)) is transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the United States. Google uses this information to assess your use of the Services, providing reports on data such as how often you visit, what pages you view when you visit, and what other websites you visited prior to visiting or using our Services, for example. Google may transfer this information to third parties, if required by law or if third parties process the information on behalf of Google.

                <p>
                  ReachMD is required to verify the identity of any person or entity that requests the disclosure or deletion of Personal Data. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us, but if you have a password-protected account, we will use our existing authentication procedures to verify your identity. For most other requests, ReachMD will ask you to provide information that matches at least two pieces of Personal Data we store about you before responding to your request. If you would like to request the specific pieces of your Personal Data that ReachMD has collected, or if you would like us to delete highly sensitive information, you will need to match at least three pieces of information we store about you, and you must provide a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose Personal Data you are requesting. We will only use Personal Data provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Data relates to you. Under such circumstances, ReachMD may follow up with you for additional information as reasonably necessary to authenticate your request. Subject to applicable legal requirements, if ReachMD refuses to act on a request you make based on the rights listed at the beginning of this section, you may have a right to submit an appeal by contacting us using the same method as when you made the initial request. In the event ReachMD must deny your appeal, we will provide a way for you to forward your complaint to the appropriate legal authorities.

                  Any removal of information or content by ReachMD does not ensure or guarantee complete or comprehensive removal in all places. The content or information may have been shared or reposted by other parties, or federal or state law may require maintenance of the content or information. ReachMD will do its best to accommodate your request to delete Personal Data we collected from you, but we cannot guarantee we can remove all Personal Data from the specified uses. If the request relates to information that ReachMD needs to make the Services function properly for you, you may not be able to use the Services properly moving forward.

                <p>
                  As previously described above, when you visit and interact with the Services, certain third parties may get access to certain information about you as referenced above, such as your device information, professional information and PLD, for the purpose of providing you online advertising personalized to your interests based on your browsing behavior. To the extent any of this sharing or third-party access may be considered a "sale" of your Personal Data under applicable privacy laws and regulations or if you otherwise have the right to opt-out of sharing for targeted advertising purposes, you may exercise choices regarding such sharing or third-party access by clicking here, or by using the email address or toll-free phone number provided in the previous paragraph.

                  Options you select through these third-party services are browser- and device-specific, and there is no guarantee that these industry-provided opt-out tools will prevent all targeted advertising. As noted previously in this Policy, it is possible that third parties may collect or receive information through the Services. Since it is possible that some of these third parties may respond differently than ReachMD to "do not track" requests, you should consult the applicable privacy policies of those third parties for that information.
